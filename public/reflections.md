## Topics I Know Very Well

### Repetition Control Structures
Loops are used to reiterate code until a condition is met for efficiency. I practiced enough times on my own to correctly create the syntax of while, for, and do-while loops. The way they are created in JavaScript is relatively the same as you do in C++, so it was easy to adapt.
### Creating Basic Functions
I was taught beforehand that functions are good for reusing code when it is needed in different parts. During this quarter, I refreshed myself on this topic so that I could organize my code better once the need arises. It also helped me find errors easier while testing my code.
### Arrays
Arrays store a collection of values with the same type in one place. Because arrays are typed the same way in both JavaScript and C++, I was able to refer to the practice exercises we accomplished last year.
### HTML Structure and Tags
I found coding HTML to be a lot easier than JavaScript or C++ because of its simple tags. The way you type them is straightforward because they use basic symbols and names. I only needed basic knowledge of each of them and then I could easily just organize elements when I make my websites.
### Relational Operators
I had practice with comparing different values in C++ last year, so relational operators were simple to master in JavaScript. The addition of "===" and "!==" was easy to learn due to their similarities with "==" and "!=". I also had a good understanding on each operator's priority in code because I found reading it like words on a sentence to be efficient. Learning about priority this year only explained it better for me.

## Topics I Require Further Practice On

### Debugging
With code someone else made, it is always challenging for me to look for errors. I can understand the error messages in VSCode, but I have trouble with logic based bugs. Although, I can debug my own code much easier. I need more practice with the different ways other people type their code.
### Event Handlers
The reason I find event handlers a bit hard is because I need the use of both HTML and JavaScript together. I know how to use both languages, but i struggle when they are put together. Added with the new syntax, it seems that I need more discussion on this topic.
### Styling
It was easy to learn CSS properties with VSCode's autocorrection. However, I believe I still need practice on the different types of measurements to fully create a reasonable looking website. I need to exercise using CSS more often and try out all of its properties so that it will get easier for me to type the correct measurements and values.
### Pre-defined Functions
Last year, we did not focus that much on pre-defined functions, as we were tasked to create our own. I know these are functions already included in the programming language, but I still need further discussion on their different applications. I also have to adapt using new JavaScript syntax.
### Arrow Functions
Arrow functions act as a shorter way to declare a function. I find it tricky because I am more used to defining functions at the end of my code. I need practice on how to type it and where I can use it on.


## My Plan of Action for the Future
For now, my strategy would be to *keep practicing*. I will task myself with solving a problem with code that requires the topics I need practice on. It would also give me experience in finding errors if I make a mistake. Next, I will find other coding tasks in other websites to use as reference. Finally, I will look at forums with other people's code and try to debug them.

## Effective & Not Effective Activities

### The Effective
* **CodeChef** - [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com) offers many practice problems for all programming languages. It helped me hone my skills in Javascript and HTML. It also explained my mistakes and what I should have done in my code.
* **Coding Tasks** - Despite popular belief last year, I believe coding tasks help you learn by providing a hands-on experience. It makes you think on your own first and try out your own solutions. 

### The Ineffective
* **Digital Garden** - The Digital Garden resources given to me did not really improve my skills because it just showed me examples. I more enjoy a doing experience than a reading experience. I also prefer being handed the tools and syntax first than the starter code being already given to solve a problem. 
* **Kahoot** - Although [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com) may provide critical-thinking skills, I believe this way is not good for beginner coders. It fosters competition which is alright for experienced coders, but I think working together is a better solution for now. There is also the factor of people randomly selecting answers, which makes it impossible to know whether someone has learned from the Kahoot or not.
