## Interesting Key Points
1. **Addressing flood control, Marcos states that he will list unfinished and _"ghost"_ projects and share them to the people.**
    * This promotes transparency from the government.
    * Others can give their knowledge and help complete these projects.
2. **Mobile app [_eGov_](https://e.gov.ph) is said to make government services easier to access.**
    * Many types of services all in one app.
    * A few taps can get you public transport, medical help, etc.

## Weird Key Points
1. **Opening of track ovals for _"free jogging"_.**
    * It is already simple to run around.
    * _Jogging was already free..?_

## Reflection
**Marcos addresses problems mainly from _agriculture, education, public transport, health, flood control, and corruption_.** He gave goals that he wishes to complete to solve these problems such as making rice P20 per kilo, giving free wifi to students, creating bridges, giving free healthcare, resuming flood control projects, and refusing corruption. He also stated several programs that will better the living of Filipinos such as the _"Walang Gutom"_ program, aiming to reduce hunger and give nutrition to others. The speech focused on many sectors and he promises to resolve their issues.

**I have mixed feelings with this year's SONA, but I am mainly confused.** I am relieved some projects that were accomplished helped many Filipinos, and he plans to get rid of corruption. _However, he does not explain briefly how he will accomplish his goals for the other problems_. For goals that are large scale, there should at least be a plan mentioned.

### In the end, I give the word "Uncertainty" to the Philippines for this year's SONA.
